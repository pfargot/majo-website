## Development Workflow

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality before each commit. These hooks:

- Run Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Run ESLint to catch JavaScript issues
- Run tests to ensure nothing is broken

To set up pre-commit hooks:

```bash
npm install husky --save-dev
npm run prepare
```

The hooks are configured in the `.husky` directory and will run automatically before each commit.

### Automated Dependency Updates

This project uses GitHub's Dependabot to automatically keep dependencies up to date. The configuration in `.github/dependabot.yml` includes:

- Weekly checks for npm package updates
- Weekly checks for GitHub Actions updates
- Automatic pull request creation for updates
- Automatic merging of minor and patch updates if:
  - All CI tests pass
  - No conflicts exist
  - No custom conditions are violated

Pull requests for major version updates require manual review.

### Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions workflows automatically:

1. Run tests and linting on all pull requests
2. Build the project to ensure it compiles correctly
3. Auto-merge Dependabot updates when all checks pass
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages on successful merges to main

You can view the workflow configurations in `.github/workflows/`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure **Node.js** is installed on your machine. Without it, the installation and build commands wonâ€™t work.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gabezurita/gabezurita.github.io.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd gabezurita.github.io
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development

To run the project locally:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will launch the website on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), where you can view live changes as you edit the files.

---

## Deployment

The website is automatically deployed using GitHub Actions whenever changes are pushed to the main branch. The deployment process:

1. Automatically builds the project using:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploys the built site to GitHub Pages

To set up deployment:

1. Ensure your repository has GitHub Pages enabled under **Settings > Pages**
2. Select "GitHub Actions" as the deployment source
3. Push your changes to the main branch - the site will be automatically built and deployed

You can monitor the deployment status in the "Actions" tab of your repository.

The site will be accessible at <https://gabezurita.github.io/gabezurita.github.io> and <https://gabo.online> once deployed.
